The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
You've dome me wrong
And you'll be sorry someday

The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away from me
The thrill is gone, yeah
The thrill is gone all the way away from me
Although i'm gonna still live on
Gonna be lonely, lonely, lonely as can be

Instrumental break

The thrill is gone yeah yeah
The thrill is gone away for good
Oh the thrill is gone yeah
Oh yeah its gone its gone its gone away for good

Somebody told me (incomprehensible)

Now i'm free free free free free baby free at last
Oh yes i'm free free free i'm free i'm free free at last
Yes i need you baby
Gone and gone and gone
The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone
Yes i'm free, i'm free free
Free from your spell
Free at last
