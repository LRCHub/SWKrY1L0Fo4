Don't play that song for me
It brings back memories of days that i once knew
The days that i spent with you
Oh no, don't let it play
It fills my heart with pain
Please stop it right away
I remember just-a what it said
It said: "darling, i love you"
You know that you lied
"Darling, i love you"
You know that you lied
"Darling, i love you"
You know that you lied, you lied,
You lied, lied, lied, lied
Remember on our first date
You kissed me and you walked away
You were only seventeen
I never thought you'd act so mean
But baby you told me you loved me
You told me you cared
You said, "i'll go with you darling almost anywhere
But darling, you know that you lied, lied, lied, lied, lied
